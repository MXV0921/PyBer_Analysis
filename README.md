# Pyber Ride Share Analysis

## Overview of Analysis Project
In this analysis project we were given two CSV files.  These files were raw data from a company 'PYBER' and the two files gave us information about different aspects of data but they shared one common category.  We utilized the Pandas function of Python to merge the two files into one DataFrame.

We then used the 'groupby' function of Python to sort our DataFrame and focus on various datapoints.  We sorted the data into three categories of types of cities, Rural, Urban, and Suburban.  Through the rest of the projects we were able to give comparisons between these city types, and provide statistical analysis of these groups.
